# Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.

Paperless-ngx forked from [paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](#community-support) Discussion of this transition can be found in issues
[#1599](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599) and [#1632](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632).

A demo is available at [demo.paperless-ngx.com](https://demo.paperless-ngx.com) using login `demo` / `demo`. _Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded._

# Getting started

The easiest way to deploy paperless is docker-compose. The files in the [`/docker/compose` directory](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose) are configured to pull the image from GitHub Packages.

If you'd like to jump right in, you can configure a docker-compose environment with our install script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies and setup apache and a database server yourself. The [documentation](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#installation) has a step by step guide on how to do it.

Migrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the [documentation on migrating](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/setup/#migrating-to-paperless-ngx) for more details.

# Important Note

> Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. **Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host** because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security (but we do try!) and you use the app at your own risk.
> **The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place**.
